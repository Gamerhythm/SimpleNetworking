# SimpleNetworking

A thing I made out of pure frustration because of how hard it is to regularly do networking in C#. It is fully designed to support firewall holepunching. It contains the following and is being updated as I do more C# networking stuff:

SimpleNetworking.UDP.Send

SimpleNetworking.UDP.Recieve

SimpleNetworking.UDP.SendAndRecieve

SimpleNetworking.URLTools.Resolve
